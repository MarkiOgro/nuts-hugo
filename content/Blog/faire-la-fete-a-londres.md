The city of London is known to be very expensive, whether it be the price of housing or access to the various clubs called "trendy". We are going to tell you about the most friendly and good-value places, and then we'll talk a bit more about the clubs in some of the most famous neighborhoods of the capital such as Soho, Brixton and Shoreditch.


# Leicester Square / Piccadilly
### good deals

It is sometimes difficult to get out in the capital when there is a lack of money, so I have listed for you the best plans to enjoy the nightlife that London is famous for !

-	[Lost in London](http://lostinlondon.com/ "Lost in London") offers many discounts on evenings, attractions or museums. It is very convenient when looking for a place to go out. As an example, an entrance for one of London's best-known boxes, the Ministry of Sounds, is offered at £8. Usual prices often goes between £15/25. However, the prices of these places are dated, so it will require a minimum of organization and sometimes even a little patience because the tickets purchased are sometimes usable for a day in the following month.

-	To party in different clubs in one night, [Nuts Pub Crawl](https://nutspubcrawl.com/ "Nuts Pub Crawl") focused on many trendy/busy bars around Leicester Square and Piccadilly Circus. The idea is to party in 4 clubs during one night. £10 discounted online tickets provide you the entry fees, discounted drinks, free shots.
