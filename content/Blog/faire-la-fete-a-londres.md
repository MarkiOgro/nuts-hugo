It is sometimes difficult to get out in the capital when there is a lack of money, so I have listed for you the best plans to enjoy the nightlife that London is famous for !

-	[Lost in London](http://lostinlondon.com/ "Lost in London") offers many discounts on evenings, attractions or museums. It is very convenient when looking for a place to go out. As an example, an entrance for one of London's best-known boxes, the Ministry of Sounds, is offered at £8. Usual prices often goes between £15/25. However, the prices of these places are dated, so it will require a minimum of organization and sometimes even a little patience because the tickets purchased are sometimes usable for a day in the following month.

The idea is to party in 4 clubs during one night. £10 discounted online tickets provide you the entry fees, discounted drinks, free shots.
