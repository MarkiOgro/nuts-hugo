If you have to do an internship as part of your studies and you like the look of London, or you want to take advantage of it to improve your English without going to the other end of the earth, then this article is for you! We’ve also been through this in the editing team so we have some little tips for you. 

#### Where to look

<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 300; line-height: 1.5; font-family: Raleway, sans-serif; font-size: medium;">Start by updating your CV in English as well as your cover letter</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Raleway, sans-serif; font-size: 1.07rem; font-weight: 300; line-height: 1.5;">If you are lucky enough that your school offers you internships, do not set them aside with the thought of being able to find better. It's not that easy to find an internship on your own.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; font-weight: 300; font-family: Raleway, sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;">Check out the students from the previous year who have also been through it. If their internship went well it is likely that their companies will recruit interns again. Ask them for the email address of their contact.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; font-weight: 300; font-family: Raleway, sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;">Visit websites such as <a href="https://www.indeed.co.uk/Internship-jobs">Indeed</a>, <a href="http://www.internwise.co.uk/">Internwise</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/internship-jobs/?country=gb">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.reed.co.uk/jobs/internship">Reed...</a></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; font-weight: 300; font-family: Raleway, sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;"><a href="https://www.internshipmapper.com/fr/villes/londres">Internshipmapper</a> (p) is a good solution, which is free. Simply <a href="https://www.internshipmapper.com/fr/inscription">register</a>, fill in your profile, check the offers, apply to the ones that suit you and the company will contact you later for a potential interview.</span></li>

</ul> 

#### Don’t forget

You should know that by doing your internship in England you do not have the same rights as in France. For example, your employer does not have to give you a bonus. Of course, some offer them, this could be to the detriment of the tasks to be carried out. By searching well you can find the ideal internship.

Good luck to you! Help us to enrich the content by sharing your ideas in the comments.
