      <description>Finding housing that matches the length of your stay, budget and area desired
Prerequisite: internet, a little patience and some savviness.
Staying less than 14 days For a short stay we recommend the following solutions: Youth hostels, Airbnb, student halls and couchsurfing
Youth Hostels London&amp;rsquo;s youth hostels are getting cooler through time. Those that we will advise you are clean, secure, and have bars inside, making it easy to meet other travellers and socialise.</description>
